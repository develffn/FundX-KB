The General view of the Chart Settings menu has several sections. Let's take a closer look at them:

## View settings

* **Custom title.** You can rename your chart panel as desired.\

* **Use custom tick size**\
  This is probably one of the most important settings in the chart. It is commonly used for cluster charts. In highly volatile instruments such as BTC or NQ futures, there may be gaps in the volumes on each cluster level. The clusters can be vertically compressed to display information better, and the compression ratio must be specified in this menu item. Below you can see a bitcoin chart with a compression of $10.

* **Time Zone.** These are the time zone settings for the chart\

* **Mouse wheel action.** This defines the action that occurs when the user rotates the mouse wheel.
* **Mouse wheel + CTRL action.**
* **Mouse wheel + SHIFT action.**\
  &#x20;\
  For all Mouse wheel actions, there are four options available: **Scroll, Zoom of the Chart Area, Zoom to Cursor, and Price scale Zoom.**

* **Drawings default availability**. If you choose <mark style="color:blue;">'All Charts with the Same Symbol,'</mark> all drawings will be applied to other charts with the same asset (ticker). This also allows you to change the color settings of the drawings on all charts at the same time.

## Data style

This tab controls the visual settings of the chart data. Here you can change the Chart Style (e.g., Candles, Bars, Area, Line) and set colors for the Up & Down Bars. Try to create an attractive interface that is easy on your eyes.

## Time scale

Use this tab to adjust the time scale. You can select the font size and color, as well as the background color for the timeline. You can also control the vertical period separators, such as Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly, and display them in different colors as desired.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Price Scale

These settings allow you to customize the price scale. There are three important points here, let's examine each one:

* **Scale type**. This allows you to choose which type of scale will be displayed on the chart, such as a normal display, percentage display, or logarithmic scale.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Zoom**. Here you can adjust the vertical scaling of the chart.

![Price Scaling on the chart panel](../../.gitbook/assets/price-scaling.gif)

* **Highlight prices**. Adjusts the color and font of the current price on the chart. Gives the opportunity to highlight the minimums and maximums of the previous day and limits on the instrument

## Visual trading&#x20;

This tab allows you to include settings to display the current position on the chart and display already completed trades.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (117).png>)

**Show positions**. This option allows you to enable or disable the display of current positions on the chart.

The **Pnl** type allows you to choose the display of profit/loss on an open position in ticks or currency.

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Pnl** type allows you to choose to display the position in currency only for those connections where this option exists.
{% endhint %}

**Show orders**. The option allows you to enable or disable the display of work orders on the chart.&#x20;

**Trade through Order entry panel**. If this option is enabled, mouse trade mode will be disabled, and when the mouse clicks on the chart, the associated order entry panel for this quote will automatically open. The mouse trade mode is the same as : clicking the right mouse button will open a panel for entering a limit order for a "Sell" deal at the marked price on the chart; click the left mouse button to open the panel for entering a limit order for a "Buy" deal at the marked price on the chart;



## Order entry

These are the settings of the order entry panel. The most interesting thing here is that you can set the standard number of entry orders which correspond to your risks. This is very convenient for manual trading.&#x20;

[How to use the order entry panel read here](../../trading-panels/order-entry/)

**Mouse trading mode**. There are two modes available to choose from:

**single order**. Once the order is set, the mouse trading mode is automatically disabled.

**multiple orders**. Mouse trading mode will be active until it is deactivated.

![Info Window on the chart](../../.gitbook/assets/info-window.gif)

## Volume Bars

This tab is used to adjust the volume histogram at the bottom of the chart. You can choose the colors for the histogram that you prefer. You can also select a color scheme for coloring the chart, adjusting the color of the volume histogram based on the direction of the price bar, or changing the color depending on whether the volume is higher or lower at the moment.

## Hotkeys

This tab is for configuring your keyboard shortcuts. Here, you can configure functions like changing the volume with one button, drawing levels or trend channels, canceling orders, and many other useful functions. In general, you can assign almost any action to your preferred key combination.
