### How to manage Quick Order Quantity buttons

The Quick Order Quantity buttons are designed to help you adjust the specified volume with a single click based on your trading strategy. You can set default parameters that you frequently use and need to quickly adjust the values. Additionally, these buttons can apply any formula to calculate the order volume, allowing for greater flexibility in order sizing.
